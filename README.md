Terminates all Spotify processes.

Due to getting fed up with launching Windows Task Manager to deal with https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux-Windows-Web-Player/Windows-10-frequent-crashes/m-p/1289109#M149902, I created this utility to automatically terminate all Spotify processes for me.

Written in .Net Core, it might also work on OS X or Linux. Or it might not. I haven't needed to use it on either of those.
